# NovelAI Image Metadata Scripts

Meta data extraction scripts for images generated with NovelAI's image generation functionality.

`nai_meta.py` extracts prompt information and other settings from the alpha channel of NAI generated images. The information is stored in the stealth pnginfo format.

`nai_sig.py` will verify the signature in the `signed_hash` field, which allows us to verify whether an image was generated by our models. No user specific data is included in this field.
